Ideas for how the squiggles can play
1. Play the root note if they have it, if they have multiple play the lowest/first
2. Play any note in the chord, if they have it
3. Start on a random note in the chord, then following that go to the closest note you have that is in the chord
4. Triads?
5. More planning, play x chords first and then have the squiggles try to lead their voices between the chords
